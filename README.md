# 🛍️ SAQAYA E-Commerce App

This is a Vue.js-based E-Commerce web application developed during my **frontend internship at SAQAYA**. The project is designed to simulate a real-world online store while applying modern frontend practices and tooling.

> ✅ Starting with the **Options API** and gradually migrating to the **Composition API**, this project also features **unit testing with Jest** and follows the **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology for scalable and maintainable styling.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Vue 3**
- **Vue Router**
- **Jest** (for unit testing)
- **BEM** (styling methodology)
- **Pinia** (planned state management)
- **Vite** (or Vue CLI depending on team setup)
