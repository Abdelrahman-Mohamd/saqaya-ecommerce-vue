    # State Management - Vuex Implementation

This project now uses **Vuex 4** for state management with namespaced modules.

## Structure:

- `index.ts` - Main Vuex store configuration
- `modules/cart.ts` - Cart management (add, remove, clear, totals)
- `modules/products.ts` - Product management (fetch, find by ID)

## Migration Completed:

- ✅ Migrated from Pinia to Vuex with full TypeScript support
- ✅ Namespaced modules for better organization
- ✅ All components updated to use Vuex helpers
- ✅ Cart functionality (add, remove, quantities, persistence)
- ✅ Product sorting functionality added
- ✅ Real-time reactive updates across components

## Features:

- Cart management with local storage persistence
- Product fetching and caching
- Sort products by price, rating, or name
- Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces
